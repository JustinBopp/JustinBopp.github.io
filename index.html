        <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Justin Bopp at work" /></span>
        <p>I am a Ph.D. student in Astrophysics & Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, where I investigate compact objects, stellar explosions, and the extreme physics governing the most energetic events in the universe. My work sits at the intersection of high‑energy astrophysics, numerical simulations, and observational signatures of transient phenomena.</p>
        <p>Before MSU, I completed my master’s degree at CUNY, working with Dr. Ore Gottlieb at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (Flatiron Institute). In that work, I analyzed 3D GRMHD simulations of collapsars—massive stars collapsing directly into black holes—with a focus on understanding how accretion‑disk dynamics generate outflows even in the absence of black hole spin.</p>
        <p>Alongside research, I care deeply about mentorship, accessibility, and representation in STEM. Through programs such as AstroCom NYC, MSU Stellar Mentorship, and my outreach work organizing astronomy events, I aim to help build a more inclusive astrophysics community. My long‑term goal is a career in academia combining research, teaching, and community building.</p>

        <center><b><font size="5">GRMHD Simulations of Non‑Spinning Black Hole Collapsars</font></b></center>
        <p>
          My thesis research at the City University of New York (CUNY), conducted at the
          Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) at the Flatiron Institute under the
          supervision of Dr. Ore Gottlieb, investigates the dynamical evolution of
          collapsars—core-collapse supernovae that directly form black holes. Using the 3D
          GRMHD code <em>HAMR</em>, I simulate massive stellar collapse across a range of
          initial black hole natal spins to quantify how rotation influences accretion disk
          formation, magnetic flux accumulation, and the launching of outflows.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          A central finding of my work is that even a non-spinning black hole can produce
          vigorous, subrelativistic, disk-powered outflows driven solely by the angular
          momentum of the nascent accretion disk. These outflows propagate through the
          stellar envelope and ultimately break out of the progenitor’s surface, unbinding
          the star as it expands into the interstellar medium. Notably, this is the <strong>first
          simulation</strong> to demonstrate stellar breakout from outflows powered exclusively
          by an accretion disk, offering new insight into the continuum between ordinary
          CCSNe and relativistic GRB-producing collapsars.

          Through this work, I’ve developed expertise in high-performance computing,
          GRMHD simulations, and scientific communication. A related publication can be

        <p>
          Under the guidance of Dr. Brian Morsony, I contributed to the Rubin Observatory’s
          Data Preview 0.2 by adapting and implementing a Color-Match Nearest Neighbor
          (CMNN) photometric redshift estimator for simulated LSST datasets. This project
          played a key role in preparing for the launch of the Legacy Survey of Space and
          Time (LSST), rigorously testing early data-processing pipelines using DP0.2
          galaxy catalogs. By tailoring the CMNN PhotoZ algorithm for LSST data products,
          I produced accurate photometric redshift estimates without spectroscopic inputs—a
          capability that will be essential once LSST begins generating its unprecedented
          volume of observations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In addition to redshift estimation, I developed methods to associate simulated
          Type Ia supernovae with their likely host galaxies, supporting the broader goal of
          enabling reliable transient–host matching for early LSST science. Through this
          work, I gained experience with large-scale astronomical datasets, machine-learning
          methodologies, and pipeline development for next-generation survey science.
          Results from this project were presented at both AAS and APS meetings.

        <center><b><font size="5">FOAMS: Chemical Evolution Modeling</font></b></center>
        <p>
          As part of Dr. Brian Morsony’s Fitting Observed Abundances to Metals from
          Supernovae (FOAMS) project, I investigated the relative contributions of Type Ia
          and core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) to the chemical enrichment of the Milky
          Way. The FOAMS framework compares observed stellar abundances with theoretical
          nucleosynthesis yields, enabling constraints on the underlying supernova
          progenitor populations that shape Galactic chemical evolution.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          My role centered on assembling and processing large stellar abundance datasets
          from the APOGEE survey. I curated elemental abundance measurements across the
          Milky Way and fit them to nucleosynthesis models using the FOAMS pipeline to
          infer the ratios of Type Ia to CCSNe progenitors. This effort culminated in the
          construction of a catalog that maps these supernova population ratios throughout
          the Galaxy. With this foundational dataset prepared, the next phase will focus on
          identifying which chemical elements serve as the most reliable tracers of the
          underlying supernova mix.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Through this project, I strengthened my skills in statistical analysis,
          computational modeling, and the interpretation of complex astrophysical datasets.
          The experience deepened my understanding of Galactic chemical evolution and
          reinforced my commitment to a research career in astrophysics.
